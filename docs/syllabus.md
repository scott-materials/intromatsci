## Grades:

30%	Reading problem sets<br>
25%	Quizzes<br>
20%	Tests<br>
25%	Final exam

Grades for the class may be curved at the instructor’s discretion.  Guaranteed minimum values for letter grades are listed below.

100%  ≥  A  ≥ 90%  >  B  ≥  80%  >  C  ≥  70%  >  D  ≥  60%  >  F

Grades within 3% of the upper / lower cut-off will be awarded a plus / minus.

##Class components:	
**Reading (not graded):**  We will draw content primarily from textbooks on solid state chemistry and solid state physics.  Reading each chapter will be exceptionally important to your success in this course.  Please take careful notes and identify questions that you have as you read.  To help you stay on track with reading, there will be an accompanying reading problem set.

**Reading problem sets (graded):**  These are relatively easy problems that will help keep you focused on the important ideas within each reading.  These are due by 9:00 AM on the day of class.  These problem sets are submitted through Sakai.  The problem sets also allow you to submit questions to Professor Warren that may be addressed during lecture.

**Lectures (not graded):**  The lectures will be relatively short, serving to summarize the chapter’s contents.  The lectures will provide time to address student’s questions.

**In-class problems (not graded):**  A large portion of the time spent in class will focus on solving problems that illustrate important concepts from each chapter.  Students will have the opportunity to work individually and in groups, as long as social distancing is maintained.  Questions will be asked using Poll Everywhere and grades recorded based solely on participation.

**Out-of-class problem sets (not graded):**  Students will have access to additional problems and their solutions, which will provide practice for quizzes and tests.

**Quizzes (graded):** Quizzes will last ~20 minutes and the questions will be similar in style to problem sets.  Bring a calculator to all quizzes.

**Exams (graded):**  Two tests will be given.  Questions will be similar in style to the quizzes.  Bring a calculator.  Exams are take-home.

**Final exam (graded):** The final exam will be comprehensive, covering the last third of the class (50%) and the first two-thirds of the class (50%).  The final exam will take approximately three hours.  Bring a calculator.  The final is closed-book.

## Course Resources:
Students can schedule an appointment directly with Professor Warren on an as-needed basis.  Professor Warren will be available after class for ~10 minutes to answer questions.

Numerous introductory books are available in the library or online.  We use the following books in this class:

1. Solid state chemistry, 4th ed., by Lesley E. Smart and Elaine A. Moore.
2. Materials Science & Engineering, 10th ed., by William D. Callister and David G. Rethwisch.
3. Solid State Physics, by Neil W. Ashcroft and N. David Mermin.
4. Physics of semiconductor devices, 3rd ed., by S. M. Sze and Kwok K. Ng.
5. Solids and Surfaces: A Chemist's View of Bonding in Extended Structures, by Roald Hoffmann.


## Course policies:

1.    Be familiar with the UNC honor code: http://studentconduct.unc.edu
2.	Working with other students:  Only ungraded work may be performed with other students.
3.	Late work:  Reading problem sets lose 20% for each day late.  If you cannot attend a quiz, test, or exam, please let Professor Warren know as soon as possible.  A make-up exam will be scheduled.
4.	Final exam:  The course final exam is given in compliance with UNC final exam regulations and according to the UNC final exam calendar.

**Honor Code:**  Academic integrity is at the heart of Carolina and we all are responsible for upholding the ideals of honor and integrity.  All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the honor system. Your full participation and observance of the Honor Code is expected.  All work that you submit must be your own, including the reading problem sets, quizzes, tests, and final exam.  Students will earn a zero on any assignment where unauthorized collaboration occurs, including posting course material to “study” sites.

**Syllabus changes:** Professor Warren may make changes to the syllabus, including due dates and test dates, when unforeseen circumstances occur. These changes will be announced as early as possible so that students can adjust their schedules.

**Title IX resources:** Any student who is impacted by discrimination, harassment, interpersonal (relationship) violence, sexual violence, sexual exploitation, or stalking is encouraged to seek resources on campus or in the community. Please contact the Director of Title IX Compliance (Adrienne Allison – Adrienne.allison@unc.edu), Report and Response Coordinators in the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office (reportandresponse@unc.edu), Counseling and Psychological Services (confidential), or the Gender Violence Services Coordinators (gvsc@unc.edu; confidential) to discuss your specific needs. Additional resources are available at safe.unc.edu.

**Counseling:** Counseling and psychological services (CAPS) is strongly committed to addressing the mental health needs of a diverse student body through timely access to consultation and connection to clinically appropriate services, whether for short or long-term needs. Go to the CAPS website (https://caps.unc.edu) or visit their facilities on the third floor of the Campus Health Services building to learn more.

**Accessibility:** Accessibility Resource Services (ARS) implements reasonable accommodations for students with learning disabilities, physical disabilities, mental health struggles, chronic medical conditions, temporary disability, or pregnancy complications, all of which can impair student success. See the ARS website for contact and registration information: https://ars.unc.edu/about-ars/contact-us.
