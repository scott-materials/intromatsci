>"If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied."

## Atomic size

So, let's dive into the world of atoms, the tiny Lego blocks that constitute our universe.  If there was one number you should know about atomic size, it is this:  atoms have a size of 1 Ångstrom, or 10<sup>&#8209;10</sup> m.  Often, students have confusion about atomic size in part because there are several common units used to describe atoms besides Ångstroms.  Because of nanoscience, we often see nanometers used, where 1 nm = 10 Å, so that an atom is 0.1 nm in size.  But when you dive into expert literature, you'll see authors prefer either Ångstroms or picometers, where 1 pm = 0.01 Å, so that an atom is 100 pm in size.  I often tell my students to have committed to memory that an atom is 1 Å, since it is so useful for making rough estimates.

For example:  How many atoms are in 1 mL (1 cm<sup>3</sup>)?  Or how many atoms are on a 1 cm<sup>2</sup> surface?  Easy.  10<sup>8</sup> atoms lined up in a row will measure 1 cm, so 10<sup>8<sup>3</sup></sup> or 10<sup>24</sup> will be in 1 mL.  Likewise, there will be 10<sup>16</sup> atoms in 1 cm<sup>2</sup>.  In other words, there's about 1 mol of atoms in 1 mL, as a rather rough approximation.  In fact, you probably know that pure water has a concentration of 55.5 M.  So our estimate is too large by a factor of 18.  A common surface, Si, has 8 × 10<sup>14</sup> atoms per cm<sup>2</sup>, so our estimate is too large by a factor of 12.  For both of these examples, it shows us that our "1 Å" estimate is a little too small.  In fact, you'll find better estimates if you suppose that it is the **radius** that is 1 Å rather than the diameter. Because we doubled atomic size, we have 2<sup>3</sup> = 8× fewer atoms per unit volume, or 2<sup>2</sup> = 4× fewer atoms per unit area.  So our estimates of water concentration and silicon surface concentration are now too large by about 4×.  That's pretty good!  We didn't even tailor our estimate based on elemental composition!

Let's do that.  If we start with our assumption of a 1 Å radius, how should we tailor this?

**Neutral, isolated atoms:**  The radius of a single atom that is surrounded by vacuum ranges from 3 Å at the bottom left of the periodic table to 1.3 Å at the top right (helium)[^1].

It should be noted that although defining radii sizes is extremely useful, it is also arbitrary.  In the example above, the authors defined the radius as the distance where the electron density dropped below an value of 0.007 e- per Å<sup>3</sup>. The radii given in this table give values similar to a standard "van der Waals", i.e., non-bonded radius.

**Ions:** This is where things get complicated, since atoms can exist in varying oxidation states.  But, in general, r<sub>cation</sub> < r<sub>neutral</sub> < r<sub>anion</sub> since the core electrons (and to some extent the valence electrons) decrease the attraction of the added electrons to the nucleus.  Calculations from the same paper[^1] indicate that an atom gets larger (or smaller) by about 0.3 Å for every electron added (or removed).
